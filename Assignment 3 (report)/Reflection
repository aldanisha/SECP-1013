he industrial talk taught me that we need to be bold in our communication with others, ask questions about the issues we are facing, 
and don't be afraid to ask our manager or supervisor for help if we don't know something. In order to increase trust within our team and 
strengthen relationships with our coworkers, we must also cultivate positive working relationships. This will lead to a more cohesive team.
Subsequently, I came to the realization that I would face numerous challenges in my pursuit of becoming a system developer. Additionally,
I need to improve my ability to communicate more pro-actively and maintain composure when faced with challenges.
